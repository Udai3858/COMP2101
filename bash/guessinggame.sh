Let's play a game.
I will pick a secret number from 1 to 10 and you have to guess it.
If you get it right, you get a virtual prize.
Here we go!

secretnumber=$(($RANDOM % 10 +1)) # save our secret number to compare later

# This loop repeatedly asks the user to guess and tells them if they got the right answer
# TASK 1: Test the user input to make sure it is not blank
# TASK 2: Test the user input to make sure it is a number from 1 to 10 inclusive
# TASK 3: Give them better feedback, telling them if their guess is too low, or too high
